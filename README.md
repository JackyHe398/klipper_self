## macros
### G29 macros for automatic bed levelling:

You may type "G29 Txx" in the console, where xx is the bed temperature. It is used to reduce the error of thermal expansion and contraction. 
If the perimeter "T" is not provided, it will not preheat the bed and will be leveled under room temperature.

### PREHEAT
Preheat the machine. You can change the temperature in the printer.cfg

*other macros are useless for human being. It is just for the machine. You may disable them under "Interface setting >> Macros"*
